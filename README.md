## The Task
Create a simple application that utilises GitHub APIs to allow a user to search for a repository by name.  The application should also offer a detail view for viewing more information about a repository.  This detail view should include the repositoryâ€™s readme, if available, and the number of open issues, number of forks, etc.

### Notes
The application should utilise best practices for code that you write.
You can use any frontend framework except jQuery, preferably with React
